Prerequisites: 	Opencv-2.1.0 or higher
				ffmpeg
				mplayer(optional).

The video capture programe was written in C using the OpenCV computer vision library.
The video is captured and send to client as grayscale, while a copy is been saved in the directory
of the programe source files in the server side. 

The saved video is compressed using DIVX codec and the output video stream is mpeg4, when ever the programe 
starts it will over write the previous saved out.avi file so we can retrive this file afer flight. we can as 
well have the file change name with same extension so that when even the program runs a new video file is 
saved but this will take up space over a period of time.

For the sending of video streams to the client, was succefull but could not send to other computer on same 
network, this could probarbly be an issue with the NOMAD firewall.

Compression was a big problem, thus we could get a work around solution by striping the colors of the raw 
video to 1=channel, in that way frames can be reduced and sent to the client side. 

We are still trying to optimize this solution so we can get a colored video in the client and also the UI 
might decide to save video while recieving frames.

At this stage full testing of the program in CUNIT has not been done, but will be done soon.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM:
* Sending video to client on another machine
* Playing video on UI using any video player
* decode back to the original raw color in the client side (not sure how.)
