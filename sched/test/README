How to make tests:

DETAILS:
******************************
For running the tests on sched_scheduler_h the sched_scheduler module will 
replace the actual function pointers with stubs provided in the sched_stubs.c file.
In this way the scheduler will still behave as it were the real function pointers but you
don't have to compile all the files for the project.
******************************

HOW TO:
******************************
Simple type "make test" without the quatation marks and then run ./testsuite
