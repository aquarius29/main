How to make tests:

DETAILS:
******************************
For running the CUNIT tests on sched_scheduler_h the sched_scheduler module will 
replace the actual function pointers with stubs provided in the sched_stubs.c file.
In this way the scheduler will still behave as it were the real function pointers but you
don't have to compile all the files for the project.

There is also an option to make a simulated scheduler to see an actual simulated execution
of the batman implementation. This will produce a log in .txt format with 500 iterations
printed out.
