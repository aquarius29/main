Stab group README:

The code is structered so that it can be compiled for both the 
pc and the arduino. 

The code can be compiled with the following taregets:

*) make pc: compiles the code for the pc. The simulator is used to simulate output from the gyro and accelerometer.

*) make mega/ make uno: compiles the code for arduino and flashes it to the board. Real data is read from the sensors.
