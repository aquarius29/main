To get all this shit to compile outside the scheduler context create a main.c and put this code inside it. main.c is ignored by the .gitignore rules because there should be no such file in the final product.

/* main.c */
#include "moto_interface.h"

int main(void){

  moto_init();
  moto_run();

}
